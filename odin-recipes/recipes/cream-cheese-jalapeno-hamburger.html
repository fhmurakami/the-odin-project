    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      These are the best burgers I've ever had. My mother made a version of
      these and I changed it a little. Instead of jalapeno peppers you can add
      anything or just do the cream cheese. Trust me, your family and/or guests
      will beg for the recipe! Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper</li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>8 (2 ounce) hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir together jalapenos and cream cheese in a small bowl.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Divide ground beef into 16 portions. Pat out each one to a thickness
          of 1/4 inch.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spoon some cream cheese mixture onto the center of 1/2 of the patties.
          Top with the remaining patties, and press the edges together to seal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook on the preheated grill until well done, about 10 minutes per
          side. Don't press down on the burgers as they cook, or the cheese will
          ooze out.
